This repository contains the analysis, description and output files for 
the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project. 

The main objective of the analysis is to form a tidy data table from a few disparate 
sources. The data is derived from a record of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements
from smartphones that volunteers (subjects) had attached to their waist while performing
6 types of activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing 
and laying.

Here is a quick description of the various files :

              the R script run_analysis.R
run_analysis.R : The R script that does all the data wrangling. It's output is the 
                .txt file samsung_tidy_data.txt
samsung_tidy_data.txt : Final tidy data in the form of a table stored in .txt format
